\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Hello, and welcome.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Thank you for making time to
view this Palo Alto Networks

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
cloud-focused webinar.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We are pleased you could attend.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And we are looking forward
to sharing you some insights

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that we have that we think
you will find interesting.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
My name is Nathaniel Quist.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
I am the manager of the Cloud
Threat Intelligence team

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
for Palo Alto Networks Cortex.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
My team works closely with
researchers of Unit 42's threat

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
intelligence to focus
on the who, how,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and what of cloud attacks.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Specifically, who is
attacking cloud infrastructure

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and the applications
that are hosted there,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
how they are doing it, and
then what types of operations

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
are they using to
perform these attacks?

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We take all of this knowledge.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And we continually improve the
Cortex detection, prevention,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and response
capabilities to ensure

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that you are equipped with the
latest threat intelligence,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and it can ensure that
your cloud environments are

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
staying secure.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
I am also presenting
with Daphna Shemesh.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Daphna, want to
introduce herself?

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Sure.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Thank you, Nathaniel.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
I'm Daphna Shemesh.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
I'm Director of
Product Management

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
here at Palo Alto Networks.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And my team is in charge of
building the best security

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
products for your
cloud environment.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We are here to make sure that
your environment is secured end

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to end.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
From the endpoint, to the
cloud, to the network,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
we're here to make sure that
every single stakeholder

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
in your organization has what
they need to see, understand,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and respond to what's going
on in their cloud environment.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So during this
webinar, we're going

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to be covering three
primary points.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We're going to be looking at
the reality of cloud attacks.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We're going to be seeing what
types of security attacks

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and what that security
perspective looks like today.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And, finally, we'll be
introducing the Palo Alto

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Networks Cloud Detection
and Response-- or CDR--

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
module that will be used
in the Cortex platform.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We'll be giving you concrete
examples of the attacks

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and a firm understanding
of how CDR will keep you

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and your environment secure
given today's advanced threat

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
landscape.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So in order to focus on the
reality of cloud attacks,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
I want to lead you through
what we're currently seeing.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
As you know, businesses
today run more applications

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
in cloud environments.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And adversaries
know this as well.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And they are following these
organizations into the cloud.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
In 2025, there are going to
be more than 750 million cloud

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
native applications
in deployment,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
meaning that there are more
applications for attackers

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to target in the cloud.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
You may be surprised to know
that 80% of the exposures,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
meaning the vulnerabilities
or misconfigurations that

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
lead to exposure
or exploitation,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
are found in cloud environments.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
That puts a vast amount
of data and applications

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
if in-cloud
environment's at risk.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Attackers know this and
are setting their sights

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
on these assets.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And we are seeing a correlation
with an elevated 66% more

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
attacks occurring in cloud
environments over the last year.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
When attackers
succeed, that impact

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
can be tremendous, averaging
in the millions of damage

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
for a successful breach.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}


\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So in this webinar,
I want to lead you

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
through two primary attack
scenarios or use cases

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that we are seeing cloud threat
actors using or performing.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We're going to look specifically
at cloud automation attacks,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
specifically leveraging
the scalability

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and the dynamic nature
of cloud environments.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And then we're also going to
look at two nation state actors

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
specifically within North Korea
or the Democratic People's

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Republic of Korea.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So first off, let's look
at the large-scale attack.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We are seeing that
attackers are specifically

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
targeting hardcoded identity and
access management credentials

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to perform a sustained attack.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
An example, this comes
from a recent incident

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that my team and
Unit 42 investigators

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
looked at in the exposure of
environment variable files.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Now, an environment
variable file

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
is a file that contains
sensitive information

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
such as authentication
credentials, access

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to applications, API endpoints,
and even cloud service platform

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
environments.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Due to their sensitive nature,
an environment variable file--

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
or a .env file-- should
never be exposed publicly,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
nor should they be stored
in a code repository.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Or it should be a little
bit more ephemeral

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and built at runtime for
that particular endpoint.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Now, the attackers
were specifically

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
looking for Mailgun credentials.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
However, they also collected
or had credential harvesting

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
techniques that collected AWS
credentials, DigitalOcean, IAM,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Identity Access Management
credentials, API

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
keys such as HubSpot, and even
OAuth tokens such as PayPal.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So there can be a pretty
tremendous effect on that.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
In total, researchers or we
found that 110,000 domains were

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
initially targeted by
this threat actor group.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And over 90,000 credentials
were harvested or collected from

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
these domains, 7,000 of which
were identity and access

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
management credentials to cloud
service platforms across more

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
than 1,200 different
organizations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So the scale of this particular
attack was pretty significant.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Doing a run-through
of the actual use

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
case of the operations,
there are a number

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
of points that we
can trigger upon

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to show that an attack
is taking place.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So let's walk through
some of those.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So the threat actor initially
targeted 110,000 domains.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And what they were looking
for were the exposures

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
of environment variable files.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Now, this gives us several
alerting opportunities

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
where we can look
for and correct

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
these potential
misconfigurations, specifically

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
hardcoded credentials.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
If we are scanning
our endpoints,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
looking for
hardcoded credentials

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and we find some, that's an
alertable, triggerable event.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We can also look for exposed
environment variable files.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
These should never be exposed.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And a rule triggering
the exposure

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
of these particular
files could also

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
be a very handy event,
also having an XDR agent

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
or a runtime agent on that
cloud endpoint, be that a web

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
hosting environment
or an API endpoint.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}


\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
After a potential compromise
of that particular endpoint,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
there is access to an
environment variable file

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that is also a triggering event.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Now once the attackers collected
that particular identity

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and access management
credential,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
they then pivoted to
that cloud platform that

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
was hosting that environment,
where they performed enumeration

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
operations as well as
created several cloud

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
resources, specifically identity
and access management users.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They were creating new users to
perform persistence operations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They were also attaching
administrator rights

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to previously known identity
and access management

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
policies or users.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They also created
lambda functions

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
in order to perform
additional operations

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
within the environment.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Both the identity and access
management credential user

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
creation as well as the
lambda function creation

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
are alertable or
triggerable events

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that we can look forward
to see if there is

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
a breach in that environment.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So once the actors had control
of those particular credentials

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and gained persistence
with that environment,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
they started scraping, in this
case, Amazon S3 buckets, RDS

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
databases.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And they were exfiltrating
that information

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to third-party
storage containers.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
The data syncing and
the copying operations

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and the deleting of
container objects

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
within those containers, those
are also triggerable events.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They left ransom notes in
the empty S3 buckets and RDS

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
databases, essentially
holding those organizations

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
for an extortion payment for
the retrieval of their systems.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Again, the creation of those
particular ransom files or text

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
files within a storage container
is a triggerable event.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So moving over into a
nation state operations,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
there are several examples of
nation state actors performing

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
malicious operations
within cloud environments.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
I want to focus specifically on
the Democratic People's Republic

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
of Korea or North Korea
and specifically two groups

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
within that particular
nation state arena,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
specifically Alluring
Pisces and Sparkling Pisces.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So Alluring Pisces has a
long and sordid history.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They're also called Lazarus.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Initial estimates say
that in 2009, they

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
were behind the Sony
Pictures breaches

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and the file wiping of
several motion pictures.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They were also behind
the SWIFT banking attack,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
which took nearly $161
billion from the SWIFT banking

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
environment.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
In more recent times,
we're seeing their shift

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to cryptocurrency
operations, specifically

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
luring victims using
spear phishing campaigns

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
into downloading new
cryptocurrency wallets, which

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
are accompanied with
malicious files or malware.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And then they are also
specifically looking

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
within cloud environments
for cryptocurrency wallets,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
specifically ATOM wallets,
or Atomic Wallets.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
As a result of those
operations, Alluring Pisces

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
has collected nearly $35
million of US currency

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
from the Atomic Wallet theft.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
In general, Alluring Pisces has
estimated to collect nearly 40%

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
of North Korea's GDP or
gross domestic product

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
as a direct result of their
cryptocurrency operations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So it's a very significant
part of their attack pattern.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Shifting over to Sparkling
Pisces, often called Kimsuky,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
they've been making
a lot of headlines

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
recently, specifically targeting
South Korean and US government

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
organizations, technology
organizations, think tanks,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and non-government
organizations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They are also the first
organization that we have really

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
seen that is starting to use AI
and LLM technologies in order

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to perform their
reconnaissance operations

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
as well as their spear
phishing operations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So they are very acceptable of
advanced and new technologies.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Their primary focus
within cloud operations

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
is as a means of disruption
and PII exfiltration--

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
or the Personally
Identifiable Information--

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
from these organizations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Looking within their
operation model,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
within the reconnaissance,
we've already

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
touched upon their LLM usage,
specifically for their victim

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
identification operations as
well as their spear phishing

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
campaigns.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Those spear phishing
campaigns, when

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
they are directed towards
their particular victims,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
offer their initial
access capabilities.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Now, within their
initial access,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
we can start seeing triggerable
events such as the downloading

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and the execution
of malicious malware

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that is attached to those
particular spear phishing

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
campaigns.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So we can see events such
as scheduled tasks, service

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
creations from unusual
processes, et cetera.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
When they move from
that particular endpoint

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
or that compromised
spear phishing campaign,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
they can start
building persistence.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
This is where we see them
move from that local on-prem

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
or user-targeted system
into a cloud environment

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
typically with the creation of
identity and access management

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
users or the attachment of
new policies to known identity

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and access management
credentials.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Their privileged
escalation operations

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
are more akin to attaching
identity and access management

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
policies to known identity
and access management users

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
or newly created user groups.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So another event where
that cloud service

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
platform can give you an
event saying policy attached.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
This is an event
that is taking place.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
On the exfiltration
side, both groups,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
both Alluring and
Sparkling, are performing

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
exfiltration operations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Alluring Pisces is mostly
focused on the exfiltration

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
of cryptocurrency wallets.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So, again, those Atomic
Wallets that they are pulling

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
from those cloud platforms.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Sparkling Pisces is looking
more for a long-term stability.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And they're focused mostly on
sensitive information, PII,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
those types of environments
from cloud storage containers.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So that exfiltration event,
that data sync operation,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and that copying operation
from a cloud container,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
cloud storage container, is
that triggerable offense.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Now, the impact of
both of these groups--

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
we've talked about
the economic impact.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
There is also a supply
chain attack impact

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
as a result from
Sparkling Pisces

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
as they are maintaining
their operation

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
within those particular
victim organizations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So from these two use cases,
there are key questions

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that we can ask
specifically around how

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
we can prevent ourselves.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Now, the first
question organizations

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
or you yourself
may be asking is,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
how can my organization
detect and respond

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to these types of attacks?

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Can my SOC fit this rule?

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Can it detect these aspects?

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So to answer some
of these questions,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
I want to turn it
over to Daphna to talk

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
about how your SOC, or
your organization SOC,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
can leverage CDR, or Cloud
Detection and Response,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to defend against these
advanced operations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So, Daphna, over to you.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
How are we going to
handle this situation?

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Today, we have siloed workflows
between cloud security

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and security operations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Those actually
create blind spots.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And it slows down
the amount of time

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
it takes to respond to
risk in the environment.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Cloud security teams
don't have proper context

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
into the root cause of attacks
because of applications

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that are constantly changing.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And on the other hand,
security operations

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
do not really have the time or
the visibility into attacks.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And that makes it challenging
for them to respond effectively.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So how do we do this?

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
To effectively stop
cloud breaches,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
the SOC needs a unified
cloud detection and response.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Organizations should still
continue with best practices

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to secure code by design.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They need to prevent
misconfigurations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They need to fix open
source vulnerabilities

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and to secure their
CI/CD pipeline.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They should also still continue
to reduce risk and stop

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
attacks by improving
their security posture,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
by prioritizing
and fixing risks,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and ensure compliance
to stop runtime attacks.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
But on top of
that, organizations

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
should also have the ability
to prevent, to detect,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to respond to attacks.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
That needs to happen real time.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And once that takes
place, they also

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
need the option to investigate
with the right context,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to respond to
those cloud attacks

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
with all the relevant tools
and accelerate the remediation.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And once all of
this is in place,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that runtime insight
needs to flow back

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
into the code-to-cloud to
prioritize remediation.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
But the same happens
the other way around.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We are using the poster data
to prioritize the security

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
operations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
That end-to-end flow allows
us to build the best possible

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
security platform.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Back in April, we took a
significant step forward.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And we launched cloud
detection and response

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
based on Cortex XDR
Agent for Cloud.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
This solution integrates
the best CNAPP capabilities

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
from Prisma Cloud, with the
robust capabilities of Cortex,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
bringing EDR analytics and
automated investigation

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
into a single solution.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Now, both teams
can prevent attacks

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and prioritize what to focus on
and how to efficiently respond.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They need to stop as
many attacks as possible

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
with the best-in-class
protection across both endpoint

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and cloud and are able
to prioritize and rapidly

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
investigate the most important
threats within a unified data

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
layer.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
That helps them to speed the
response for cloud attack

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
with an automation-first
approach.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We're now able to leverage
all the strong capabilities

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
from the CNAPP and
Cortex brought together.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So how are we building this?

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
First of all, we need to
bring in all the data,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
from the public cloud,
from private cloud,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
from workloads, from
cloud orchestrators,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
whether it's agentless
or agent-based,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and bring this into
a single data lake.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Bringing all the data
onto a single data lake

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
allows us to leverage
all our advanced tooling

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to detect, use advanced models,
use our AI capabilities,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
use our automation capabilities
on top of that structured data.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
From there on,
multiple personas,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
whether it's a security analyst
or a cloud security architect

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
can interact with this data.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They can consume with it.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They can update it.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They can work with it and
use that unified platform

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and unified management
to consume whatever

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
data is relevant for them
and provide that enrichment

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
across the board.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
In order to get there,
we're delivering

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
all these capabilities through
a single platform and a unified

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
agent for both the endpoint
and cloud security.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So let's dive deeper
into threat prevention.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And that's actually
the starting point

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
for an exceptionally security
solution delivered by Cortex.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So the first thing
and most importantly,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
XDR offers the
best-in-class protection

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to block real time attacks.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
That includes anything
between malware, ransomware,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
fileless attacks, or exploits.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Cortex is the only vendor
to achieve 100% prevention

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
in Miter ATT&CK with no modifier
or configuration changes.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We also provide
consistent protection

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
across every environment.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
That includes endpoints,
VMs, containers, Kubernetes,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and serverless workloads
using that single agent.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
That also allows you to
fine-tune the policies

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and meet the requirements
of your security needs.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And on top of that,
that agent also

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
provides real-time visibility.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
It provides you the
best visibility 24/7,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
allowing you to detect but also
investigate without the need

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to use additional tools.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Having that single point for
prevention and visibility

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
is critical for security
coverage of your environment.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So once you've prevented
as much as possible,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
we will help you prioritize your
incidents and investigations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
What we do with Cortex is
we turn disjointed data

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
into highly prioritized
incidents for investigations

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
with advanced AI.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We take the information,
whether it's

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
from the public cloud, the
private cloud, the endpoint,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
the network, or even
third-party data sources,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and we bring it in
into the system.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And then we use the power of
our AI-based detection to detect

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
the most advanced threats with
over 5,000 detectors and over

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
2,000 models.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Having unified tools and
data and AI-powered offense,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
it's time to automate
the workflows.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
This is a real automation
first approach versus just

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
a playbook at the
end of automation.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
With CDR in place, we're
automating workflows

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
by automating the incident
response with more than 1,000

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
out-of-the-box playbooks
and integrations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We also provide suggestions
that accelerate the ability

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to respond quicker.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And then we enable you to
take action and remediate

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
risks by fixing that in
the code and the cloud.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And once all of
that is in place,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
the product then learns and
adapts from previous incidents

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to improve future automation.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
The outcomes of this
approach are clear.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We see 90% reduction
of MTTR, so you can

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
respond in minutes versus days.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
There's also 75% drop in
analyst workload as a result

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
of taking this approach.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
This is critical
for your SOC to be

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
able to handle and investigate
through the amount of data

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
you're working with.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Now let's take a deeper
look into what that actually

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
looks like.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Our CDR helps customers
stop cloud breaches

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
with a unified
code-to-cloud SOC platform.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We stop the attacks.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We detect the threats in seconds
across all the security domains.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
That's first, prevention first.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
It's the cloud.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
It's the endpoint.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
It's the network,
third-party data.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
But then we bring
in all of this data.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
It's correlated.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
It's analyzed in
the same platform

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
with the same AI-driven speed.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Then the unified platform is
converging different tools

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
like SIEM, EDR, and CDR
into a single platform

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
with a single agent for
cloud and endpoint security.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We're able to reduce the MTTR to
minutes so you can stop attacks

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
before they materialize.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
End to end, looking at
your entire enterprise,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
bringing it together,
stopping where we can,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and reducing the workload-- this
is what we're doing with CDR.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Now, let's dive a little deeper.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Here what we can
see is an incident

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that is compiled from 38
alerts from 14 sources.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Those are actually a
result of identifying

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
what we're seeing as one
high-priority incident

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
with a risk score that
identifies it as a top priority.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Not only that, we also have
three response automations

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that have been presented to
resolve the incidents and one

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
playbook reaction to increase
the automation in the future,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that alongside 14 actions that
have already been executed

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to prepare for response.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So, as you can seem
all of this information

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
is presented on the
investigation for the analyst

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
in a single place, rather
across multiple consoles or tool

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
is actually helping the analysts
to focus on what he needs,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
see the full attack
story end to end,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
across all the sources
brought together

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and know what are the
next steps to take.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
This is addressing
the time imbalance

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
I mentioned earlier and
by making people more

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
efficient with technology and
enabling faster and more precise

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
processes.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Now that we looked
at an incident,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
let's take an even
deeper dive and look

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
at how CDR is looking
at a real-world attack.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
What we're seeing is that
attacks in this domain

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
are often moving from the
endpoint to the cloud.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So if we look at
this example, we're

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
seeing an initial access
through the endpoint,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
a CURL command to a host.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And that is used
to get credentials

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to then move to the cloud.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Cortex being on the endpoint
is critical at this point

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to be able to detect this
and prevent this real time.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
But it also has multiple
layers to prevent that.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
That can also be identified
through identity analytics,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
detecting this kind of
abnormal access usage.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And as you can see, as we walk
through the different steps

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
of the attack,
Cortex has the ways

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to detect and
understand what's going

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
on in the attack for
every step of the way.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So next up in the
attack, the attacker

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
is going to try to discover
what's in there in the CSP.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
They're going to use the
CLI API requests to see

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
what permissions are out there.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And while we in
Cortex see the data,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
we're able to see the
enumeration and the list

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
requests that are out there
and detect that immediately,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to see those anomalies and
detect those, surface that

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
directly to the SOC.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Next, we're going to
see how the attacker is

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
going to use privilege
escalation to create roles,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
attach policies.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}


\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Once we have that data, we're
going to see those immediately.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
We see those roles
in policy creation.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Once they're going
to execute, we're

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
going to see those resource
consumptions across the cloud.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Again, every step of the
way, those different methods

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
are going to be detected
and surfaced even.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
If attackers are able to
proceed with the attack

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
when we look at this next step
of, let's say, exfiltration,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
we have the option to
stop the data exfiltration

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and recognizing the cloud
sync requests immediately.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
But if Cortex didn't do
that and the data somehow

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
managed to get
that there, having

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that visibility of the data
allows us to also analyze

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
the impact of what
happened, what data

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
was removed, how was it done.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And we also have Unit 42 that
is there for IR investigation

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to give you a deeper dive
into this and provide you

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that impact analysis and
the next steps to handle.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Thank you so much for
joining our webinar today.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
All right, we're going to
turn over to some questions

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that we have coming
in via our chat.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
The first question is are there
nation state threat actors

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that are also targeting
cloud environments?

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}


\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
All right, so great question.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Most certainly, there are
other nation state actors

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that are targeting
cloud environments.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Some of the larger groups,
specifically Russian groups

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
like APT29, they've
had a notorious look

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
at cloud environments from way
back with the CloudDukes to more

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
recent operations with what Unit
42 calls Cloaked Ursa, where

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
they are specifically using
cloud environments for command

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and control operations in
the same manner, so to speak,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
as what I described
within our webinar,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
where they are using spear
phishing campaigns in order

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to deliver legitimate looking
URLs from Google Drive,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
using those particular links to
make a more susceptible phishing

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
link that is clickable.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And they're subsequently
exfiltrating data

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to those particular
Google Drive accounts

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and performing additional
spear phishing operations.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
There has been some
evidence that also there

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
are Chinese nation state actors
that are also performing command

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and control operations
within cloud

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
environments such
as Google, as well

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
as Yandex when they are
targeting Russian operations as

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
well.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So there's a lot of play
happening in cloud environments.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
What are some examples of
the most targeted cloud

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
applications?

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
There are a number of cloud
applications that are targeted.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Specifically, some
of the first jump

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to mind, Redis applications
are very highly

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
sought after specifically
for crypto mining operations

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
or cryptojacking operations,
as well as ransom attacks.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
My team published
a blog a while back

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
called P2P Infect or
Peer-to-Peer Infect,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
where they were using a cloud
worm that was specifically

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
targeting Redis applications
to propagate that worm

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
into additional environments.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Subsequent reporting
has come out

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that that particular group
has switched its tactics

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
from a cryptojacking operation
to a ransomware operation

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
or an extortion operation,
still using that same worming

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
technology and Redis as
that target application

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that they're going after.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
There's a number of
other applications

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that are highly targeted.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
I talked about Mailgun.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
It's sought after,
as well as Zimbra.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
There's a number of
Zimbra applications

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that have some recent
zero-day vulnerabilities that

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
have come to light over
the past month that

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
are starting to see an
uptick in operations as well.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Patch your systems, make sure
that they're latest versions

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and they are up
to date to relieve

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
a lot of those
vulnerabilities that

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
could happen within
those cloud environments.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So we have additional
questions coming in.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Here's a good one.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Is the security
coverage and behavior

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
of the endpoint, is it adapted
to cover cloud specific use

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
cases?

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
That's somewhat of a question
to Nathaniel as well.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
But the answer is yes.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}


\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
In certain manners, yes, but
it's also bigger than that.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
When we see that movement across
the endpoint in the cloud,

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
just bringing that visibility
and stories together, that

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
also gives you an understanding
of how an attack takes place

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and being able to see
how it moves around.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
It's the specific coverage of
what we are able to detect.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
But it's also bringing
all of this together

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
that is making a difference.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
That and also adapting
how the agent behaves

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
in different environments to
make sure that it's really

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
well adjusted to cloud
environments with leaner

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
resources is obviously,
again, a part of this effort

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
to deliver this solution.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
Yeah.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And if I could add on to
that from the cloud use case

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
perspective, what we're
seeing threat actors look at

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
is they are targeting or
exploiting a particular cloud

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
endpoint.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
And that endpoint has
identity and access management

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
credentials.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
It has a number of
hardcoded secrets

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
on it that those actors are
then pivoting or laterally

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
moving to cloud environments.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
So seeing that telemetry
from that endpoint as it's

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
being exploited or
post-exploitation to those keys

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
being used in cloud environment,
that telemetry and that endpoint

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
data is crucial to stopping
attacks as early as they start.

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
All right, that
concludes our webinar

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
and the time we have allotted
for our questions-and-answers

\1╝╝\4╝\5╝\8 ┘$11\x{0020}
