WEBVTT 00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.465 align:middle line:90% [MUSIC PLAYINGT 00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:09.420 align:middle line:90%T 00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.440 align:middle line:90% Hello, and welcome.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.470 align:middle line:84% Thank you for making time to view this Palo Alto Networks 00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.880 align:middle line:90% cloud-focused webinar.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.320 align:middle line:90% We are pleased you could attend.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.990 align:middle line:84% And we are looking forward to sharing you some insights 00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.340 align:middle line:84% that we have that we think you will find interesting.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.800 align:middle line:90% My name is Nathaniel Quist.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:84% I am the manager of the Cloud Threat Intelligence team 00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:90% for Palo Alto Networks Cortex.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:84% My team works closely with researchers of Unit 42's threat 00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:84% intelligence to focus on the who, howt 00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:90% and what of cloud attacks.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.560 align:middle line:84% Specifically, who is attacking cloud infrastructure 00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:84% and the applications that are hosted theree 00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:84% how they are doing it, and then what types of operatione 00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.060 align:middle line:84% are they using to perform these attacks?

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.730 align:middle line:90% We take all of this knowledge.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.990 align:middle line:84% And we continually improve the Cortex detection, prevention, 00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:84% and response capabilities to ensur, 00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.640 align:middle line:84% that you are equipped with the latest threat intelligence, 00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:84% and it can ensure that your cloud environments ar, 00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.470 align:middle line:90% staying secure.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.420 align:middle line:84% I am also presenting with Daphna Shemesh.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:84% Daphna, want to introduce herself?

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:90% Sure.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:90% Thank you, Nathaniel.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:90% I'm Daphna Shemesh.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.610 align:middle line:84% I'm Director of Product Management 00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:90% here at Palo Alto Networks.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.990 align:middle line:84% And my team is in charge of building the best security 00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.740 align:middle line:84% products for your cloud environment.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:84% We are here to make sure that your environment is secured end 00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.750 align:middle line:90% to end.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:84% From the endpoint, to the cloud, to the network, 00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:84% we're here to make sure that every single stakeholde, 00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.160 align:middle line:84% in your organization has what they need to see, understand, 00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:84% and respond to what's going on in their cloud environment.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:84% So during this webinar, we're going 00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:84% to be covering three primary points.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:84% We're going to be looking at the reality of cloud attacks.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:84% We're going to be seeing what types of security attacks 00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84% and what that security perspective looks like today.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:84% And, finally, we'll be introducing the Palo Alto 00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:84% Networks Cloud Detection and Response-- or CDR-o 00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.449 align:middle line:84% module that will be used in the Cortex platform.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:84% We'll be giving you concrete examples of the attacks 00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:84% and a firm understanding of how CDR will keep yos 00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:84% and your environment secure given today's advanced threas 00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:90% landscape.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.500 align:middle line:84% So in order to focus on the reality of cloud attacks, 00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84% I want to lead you through what we're currently seeing.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:84% As you know, businesses today run more applications 00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:90% in cloud environments.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84% And adversaries know this as well.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84% And they are following these organizations into the cloud.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:84% In 2025, there are going to be more than 750 million cloud 00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:84% native applications in deploymentd 00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:84% meaning that there are more applications for attackerd 00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:90% to target in the cloud.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84% You may be surprised to know that 80% of the exposures, 00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84% meaning the vulnerabilities or misconfigurations tha, 00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.460 align:middle line:84% lead to exposure or exploitation, 00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:90% are found in cloud environments.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84% That puts a vast amount of data and applications 00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.790 align:middle line:84% if in-cloud environment's at risk.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:84% Attackers know this and are setting their sights 00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:90% on these assets.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.580 align:middle line:84% And we are seeing a correlation with an elevated 66% more 00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:84% attacks occurring in cloud environments over the last year.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:84% When attackers succeed, that impact 00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:84% can be tremendous, averaging in the millions of damagt 00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:90% for a successful breach.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.960 align:middle line:90%
 00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.260 align:middle line:84% So in this webinar, I want to lead yo
 00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.340 align:middle line:84% through two primary attack scenarios or use case
 00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.360 align:middle line:84% that we are seeing cloud threat actors using or performing.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:84% We're going to look specifically at cloud automation attacks, 00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:84% specifically leveraging the scalabilit, 00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:84% and the dynamic nature of cloud environments.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:84% And then we're also going to look at two nation state actors 00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84% specifically within North Korea or the Democratic People's 00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.760 align:middle line:90% Republic of Korea.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:84% So first off, let's look at the large-scale attack.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:84% We are seeing that attackers are specifically 00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84% targeting hardcoded identity and access management credentialy 00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.579 align:middle line:90% to perform a sustained attack.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:84% An example, this comes from a recent incident 00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84% that my team and Unit 42 investigatort 00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84% looked at in the exposure of environment variable files.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.760 align:middle line:84% Now, an environment variable file 00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:84% is a file that contains sensitive informatioe 00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.600 align:middle line:84% such as authentication credentials, accese 00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:84% to applications, API endpoints, and even cloud service platfore 00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:90% environments.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84% Due to their sensitive nature, an environment variable file-- 00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84% or a .env file-- should never be exposed publicly- 00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.928 align:middle line:84% nor should they be stored in a code repository.

00:04:52.928 --> 00:04:54.720 align:middle line:84% Or it should be a little bit more ephemeral 00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.690 align:middle line:84% and built at runtime for that particular endpoint.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:84% Now, the attackers were specifically 00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:90% looking for Mailgun credentials.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.010 align:middle line:84% However, they also collected or had credential harvesting 00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:84% techniques that collected AWS credentials, DigitalOcean, IAMg 00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:84% Identity Access Management credentials, APg 00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.380 align:middle line:84% keys such as HubSpot, and even OAuth tokens such as PayPal.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.710 align:middle line:84% So there can be a pretty tremendous effect on that.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.950 align:middle line:84% In total, researchers or we found that 110,000 domains were 00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.420 align:middle line:84% initially targeted by this threat actor group.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.370 align:middle line:84% And over 90,000 credentials were harvested or collected from 00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:84% these domains, 7,000 of which were identity and accesm 00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:84% management credentials to cloud service platforms across morm 00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.290 align:middle line:84% than 1,200 different organizations.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.240 align:middle line:84% So the scale of this particular attack was pretty significant.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:84% Doing a run-through of the actual use 00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:84% case of the operations, there are a numbee 00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:84% of points that we can trigger upoe 00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:84% to show that an attack is taking place.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:84% So let's walk through some of those.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.380 align:middle line:84% So the threat actor initially targeted 110,000 domains.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84% And what they were looking for were the exposures 00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:90% of environment variable files.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.940 align:middle line:84% Now, this gives us several alerting opportunities 00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84% where we can look for and correcs 00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:84% these potential misconfigurations, specificalls 00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:90% hardcoded credentials.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:84% If we are scanning our endpoints, 00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:84% looking for hardcoded credential, 00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:84% and we find some, that's an alertable, triggerable event.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:84% We can also look for exposed environment variable files.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.300 align:middle line:90% These should never be exposed.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.120 align:middle line:84% And a rule triggering the exposure 00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:84% of these particular files could alse 00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:84% be a very handy event, also having an XDR agene 00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.350 align:middle line:84% or a runtime agent on that cloud endpoint, be that a wee 00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.755 align:middle line:84% hosting environment or an API endpoint.

00:06:49.755 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:90%
 00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84% After a potential compromise of that particular endpoint
 00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.400 align:middle line:84% there is access to an environment variable fil
 00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:90% that is also a triggering event.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.340 align:middle line:84% Now once the attackers collected that particular identity 00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.000 align:middle line:84% and access management credentialy 00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.600 align:middle line:84% they then pivoted to that cloud platform thay 00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:84% was hosting that environment, where they performed enumeratioy 00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:84% operations as well as created several clouy 00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:84% resources, specifically identity and access management users.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.250 align:middle line:84% They were creating new users to perform persistence operations.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:84% They were also attaching administrator rights 00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.780 align:middle line:84% to previously known identity and access managemens 00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.800 align:middle line:90% policies or users.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84% They also created lambda functions 00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:84% in order to perform additional operations 00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.480 align:middle line:90% within the environment.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.270 align:middle line:84% Both the identity and access management credential user 00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:84% creation as well as the lambda function creatior 00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84% are alertable or triggerable eventr 00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.520 align:middle line:84% that we can look forward to see if there ir 00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.940 align:middle line:90% a breach in that environment.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:84% So once the actors had control of those particular credentials 00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.370 align:middle line:84% and gained persistence with that environments 00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:09.370 align:middle line:84% they started scraping, in this case, Amazon S3 buckets, RDs 00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:90% databases.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.700 align:middle line:84% And they were exfiltrating that information 00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.420 align:middle line:84% to third-party storage containers.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.810 align:middle line:84% The data syncing and the copying operations 00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:84% and the deleting of container objects 00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84% within those containers, those are also triggerable events.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:84% They left ransom notes in the empty S3 buckets and RDS 00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:84% databases, essentially holding those organizationS 00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:84% for an extortion payment for the retrieval of their systems.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.150 align:middle line:84% Again, the creation of those particular ransom files or text 00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.200 align:middle line:84% files within a storage container is a triggerable event.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:84% So moving over into a nation state operations, 00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:84% there are several examples of nation state actors performin, 00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:84% malicious operations within cloud environments.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.940 align:middle line:84% I want to focus specifically on the Democratic People's Republic 00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.150 align:middle line:84% of Korea or North Korea and specifically two groupc 00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:84% within that particular nation state arenac 00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.010 align:middle line:84% specifically Alluring Pisces and Sparkling Pisces.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.400 align:middle line:84% So Alluring Pisces has a long and sordid history.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.800 align:middle line:90% They're also called Lazarus.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.160 align:middle line:84% Initial estimates say that in 2009, they 00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.800 align:middle line:84% were behind the Sony Pictures breachey 00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:84% and the file wiping of several motion pictures.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.930 align:middle line:84% They were also behind the SWIFT banking attack, 00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:33.450 align:middle line:84% which took nearly $161 billion from the SWIFT bankin, 00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:90% environment.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.350 align:middle line:84% In more recent times, we're seeing their shift 00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.460 align:middle line:84% to cryptocurrency operations, specificallt 00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:84% luring victims using spear phishing campaignt 00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:84% into downloading new cryptocurrency wallets, whict 00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.410 align:middle line:84% are accompanied with malicious files or malware.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.530 align:middle line:84% And then they are also specifically looking 00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.590 align:middle line:84% within cloud environments for cryptocurrency walletsg 00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84% specifically ATOM wallets, or Atomic Wallets.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:84% As a result of those operations, Alluring Pisces 00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:84% has collected nearly $35 million of US currencs 00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:90% from the Atomic Wallet theft.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84% In general, Alluring Pisces has estimated to collect nearly 40% 00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.110 align:middle line:84% of North Korea's GDP or gross domestic produc% 00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:24.620 align:middle line:84% as a direct result of their cryptocurrency operations.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:84% So it's a very significant part of their attack pattern.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.810 align:middle line:84% Shifting over to Sparkling Pisces, often called Kimsuky, 00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:84% they've been making a lot of headline, 00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:84% recently, specifically targeting South Korean and US governmen, 00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.600 align:middle line:84% organizations, technology organizations, think tanks, 00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.930 align:middle line:84% and non-government organizations.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.690 align:middle line:84% They are also the first organization that we have really 00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:55.600 align:middle line:84% seen that is starting to use AI and LLM technologies in ordey 00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:84% to perform their reconnaissance operationy 00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:84% as well as their spear phishing operations.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.420 align:middle line:84% So they are very acceptable of advanced and new technologies.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.300 align:middle line:84% Their primary focus within cloud operations 00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:12.667 align:middle line:84% is as a means of disruption and PII exfiltration-s 00:11:12.667 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:84% or the Personally Identifiable Information-s 00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:90% from these organizations.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.303 align:middle line:84% Looking within their operation model, 00:11:20.303 --> 00:11:21.970 align:middle line:84% within the reconnaissance, we've alread, 00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.690 align:middle line:84% touched upon their LLM usage, specifically for their victi, 00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.720 align:middle line:84% identification operations as well as their spear phishin, 00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.040 align:middle line:90% campaigns.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:84% Those spear phishing campaigns, when 00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.970 align:middle line:84% they are directed towards their particular victimsn 00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.550 align:middle line:84% offer their initial access capabilities.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:84% Now, within their initial access, 00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:44.740 align:middle line:84% we can start seeing triggerable events such as the downloadin, 00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.220 align:middle line:84% and the execution of malicious malwar, 00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.060 align:middle line:84% that is attached to those particular spear phishin, 00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:90% campaigns.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.290 align:middle line:84% So we can see events such as scheduled tasks, service 00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.210 align:middle line:84% creations from unusual processes, et cetera.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:84% When they move from that particular endpoint 00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:84% or that compromised spear phishing campaignt 00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.640 align:middle line:84% they can start building persistence.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.170 align:middle line:84% This is where we see them move from that local on-prem 00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.370 align:middle line:84% or user-targeted system into a cloud environmenm 00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:84% typically with the creation of identity and access managemenm 00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:25.470 align:middle line:84% users or the attachment of new policies to known identitm 00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:84% and access management credentials.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:84% Their privileged escalation operations 00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:84% are more akin to attaching identity and access managemens 00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:84% policies to known identity and access management users 00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.760 align:middle line:90% or newly created user groups.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84% So another event where that cloud service 00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.260 align:middle line:84% platform can give you an event saying policy attached.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.290 align:middle line:84% This is an event that is taking place.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:51.490 align:middle line:84% On the exfiltration side, both groups, 00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.840 align:middle line:84% both Alluring and Sparkling, are performin, 00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:90% exfiltration operations.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:84% Alluring Pisces is mostly focused on the exfiltration 00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.442 align:middle line:90% of cryptocurrency wallets.

00:13:02.442 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:84% So, again, those Atomic Wallets that they are pulling 00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.070 align:middle line:90% from those cloud platforms.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.430 align:middle line:84% Sparkling Pisces is looking more for a long-term stability.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.810 align:middle line:84% And they're focused mostly on sensitive information, PII, 00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.510 align:middle line:84% those types of environments from cloud storage containers.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.800 align:middle line:84% So that exfiltration event, that data sync operation, 00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.520 align:middle line:84% and that copying operation from a cloud container, 00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:84% cloud storage container, is that triggerable offense.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.040 align:middle line:84% Now, the impact of both of these groups-- 00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84% we've talked about the economic impact.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:84% There is also a supply chain attack impact 00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:84% as a result from Sparkling Piscet 00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.950 align:middle line:84% as they are maintaining their operatiot 00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:49.450 align:middle line:84% within those particular victim organizations.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:54.340 align:middle line:84% So from these two use cases, there are key questions 00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:84% that we can ask specifically around hos 00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.708 align:middle line:90% we can prevent ourselves.

00:13:58.708 --> 00:14:00.250 align:middle line:84% Now, the first question organizations 00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.330 align:middle line:84% or you yourself may be asking iss 00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84% how can my organization detect and respons 00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:90% to these types of attacks?

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.430 align:middle line:90% Can my SOC fit this rule?

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.580 align:middle line:90% Can it detect these aspects?

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.870 align:middle line:84% So to answer some of these questions, 00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:84% I want to turn it over to Daphna to tal, 00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:84% about how your SOC, or your organization SOC, 00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.350 align:middle line:84% can leverage CDR, or Cloud Detection and Response, 00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:84% to defend against these advanced operations.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:90% So, Daphna, over to you.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.330 align:middle line:84% How are we going to handle this situation?

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.450 align:middle line:84% Today, we have siloed workflows between cloud security 00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:90% and security operations.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.280 align:middle line:84% Those actually create blind spots.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:84% And it slows down the amount of time 00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84% it takes to respond to risk in the environment.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.620 align:middle line:84% Cloud security teams don't have proper context 00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.160 align:middle line:84% into the root cause of attacks because of applicationt 00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.420 align:middle line:90% that are constantly changing.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.480 align:middle line:84% And on the other hand, security operations 00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.300 align:middle line:84% do not really have the time or the visibility into attacks.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:84% And that makes it challenging for them to respond effectively.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:90% So how do we do this?

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.030 align:middle line:84% To effectively stop cloud breaches, 00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.680 align:middle line:84% the SOC needs a unified cloud detection and response.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:84% Organizations should still continue with best practices 00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:90% to secure code by design.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.080 align:middle line:84% They need to prevent misconfigurations.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.020 align:middle line:84% They need to fix open source vulnerabilities 00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:84% and to secure their CI/CD pipeline.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.890 align:middle line:84% They should also still continue to reduce risk and stop 00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.300 align:middle line:84% attacks by improving their security posturep 00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.690 align:middle line:84% by prioritizing and fixing risksp 00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.630 align:middle line:84% and ensure compliance to stop runtime attacks.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:84% But on top of that, organizations 00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84% should also have the ability to prevent, to detects 00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.950 align:middle line:90% to respond to attacks.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:90% That needs to happen real time.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.780 align:middle line:84% And once that takes place, they also 00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:84% need the option to investigate with the right contexto 00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:84% to respond to those cloud attacko 00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.620 align:middle line:84% with all the relevant tools and accelerate the remediation.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.180 align:middle line:84% And once all of this is in place, 00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.900 align:middle line:84% that runtime insight needs to flow bac, 00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:84% into the code-to-cloud to prioritize remediation.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.155 align:middle line:84% But the same happens the other way around.

00:16:13.155 --> 00:16:17.520 align:middle line:84% We are using the poster data to prioritize the security 00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:90% operations.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:84% That end-to-end flow allows us to build the best possible 00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.490 align:middle line:90% security platform.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:middle line:84% Back in April, we took a significant step forward.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:84% And we launched cloud detection and response 00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:84% based on Cortex XDR Agent for Cloud.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.220 align:middle line:84% This solution integrates the best CNAPP capabilities 00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.650 align:middle line:84% from Prisma Cloud, with the robust capabilities of Cortexs 00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.880 align:middle line:84% bringing EDR analytics and automated investigatios 00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:90% into a single solution.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.160 align:middle line:84% Now, both teams can prevent attacks 00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:84% and prioritize what to focus on and how to efficiently respond.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:84% They need to stop as many attacks as possible 00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:84% with the best-in-class protection across both endpoine 00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.190 align:middle line:84% and cloud and are able to prioritize and rapidle 00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.849 align:middle line:84% investigate the most important threats within a unified date 00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:90% layer.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:84% That helps them to speed the response for cloud attack 00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:84% with an automation-first approach.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.339 align:middle line:84% We're now able to leverage all the strong capabilities 00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:16.369 align:middle line:84% from the CNAPP and Cortex brought together.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:90% So how are we building this?

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.780 align:middle line:84% First of all, we need to bring in all the data, 00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:84% from the public cloud, from private cloud, 00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.910 align:middle line:84% from workloads, from cloud orchestrators, 00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.270 align:middle line:84% whether it's agentless or agent-based, 00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.000 align:middle line:84% and bring this into a single data lake.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.540 align:middle line:84% Bringing all the data onto a single data lake 00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:41.700 align:middle line:84% allows us to leverage all our advanced tooline 00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84% to detect, use advanced models, use our AI capabilitiese 00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:84% use our automation capabilities on top of that structured data.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.060 align:middle line:84% From there on, multiple personas, 00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.930 align:middle line:84% whether it's a security analyst or a cloud security architec, 00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:90% can interact with this data.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:01.960 align:middle line:90% They can consume with it.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.830 align:middle line:90% They can update it.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:84% They can work with it and use that unified platform 00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:84% and unified management to consume whatevem 00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.530 align:middle line:84% data is relevant for them and provide that enrichmenm 00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:90% across the board.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.490 align:middle line:84% In order to get there, we're delivering 00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.670 align:middle line:84% all these capabilities through a single platform and a unifieg 00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:25.170 align:middle line:84% agent for both the endpoint and cloud security.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.330 align:middle line:84% So let's dive deeper into threat prevention.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:84% And that's actually the starting point 00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.420 align:middle line:84% for an exceptionally security solution delivered by Cortex.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.030 align:middle line:84% So the first thing and most importantly, 00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.730 align:middle line:84% XDR offers the best-in-class protectio, 00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:90% to block real time attacks.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.480 align:middle line:84% That includes anything between malware, ransomware, 00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.990 align:middle line:90% fileless attacks, or exploits.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:84% Cortex is the only vendor to achieve 100% prevention 00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:56.490 align:middle line:84% in Miter ATT&CK with no modifier or configuration changes.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:84% We also provide consistent protection 00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.830 align:middle line:90% across every environment.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:84% That includes endpoints, VMs, containers, Kubernetes, 00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:84% and serverless workloads using that single agent.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:84% That also allows you to fine-tune the policies 00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.590 align:middle line:84% and meet the requirements of your security needs.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.770 align:middle line:84% And on top of that, that agent also 00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:90% provides real-time visibility.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.360 align:middle line:84% It provides you the best visibility 24/7, 00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.120 align:middle line:84% allowing you to detect but also investigate without the nee, 00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:90% to use additional tools.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:33.110 align:middle line:84% Having that single point for prevention and visibility 00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:37.340 align:middle line:84% is critical for security coverage of your environment.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.320 align:middle line:84% So once you've prevented as much as possible, 00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:84% we will help you prioritize your incidents and investigations.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.480 align:middle line:84% What we do with Cortex is we turn disjointed data 00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:84% into highly prioritized incidents for investigationa 00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:90% with advanced AI.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:84% We take the information, whether it's 00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.970 align:middle line:84% from the public cloud, the private cloud, the endpoints 00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:84% the network, or even third-party data sourcess 00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.910 align:middle line:84% and we bring it in into the system.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.940 align:middle line:84% And then we use the power of our AI-based detection to detect 00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:09.560 align:middle line:84% the most advanced threats with over 5,000 detectors and ovet 00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.950 align:middle line:90% 2,000 models.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:16.940 align:middle line:84% Having unified tools and data and AI-powered offense, 00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.530 align:middle line:84% it's time to automate the workflows.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:84% This is a real automation first approach versus just 00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.010 align:middle line:84% a playbook at the end of automation.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.060 align:middle line:84% With CDR in place, we're automating workflows 00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.615 align:middle line:84% by automating the incident response with more than 1,00s 00:20:33.615 --> 00:20:36.040 align:middle line:84% out-of-the-box playbooks and integrations.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84% We also provide suggestions that accelerate the ability 00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.650 align:middle line:90% to respond quicker.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84% And then we enable you to take action and remediate 00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.100 align:middle line:84% risks by fixing that in the code and the cloud.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:84% And once all of that is in place, 00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:84% the product then learns and adapts from previous incident, 00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.480 align:middle line:90% to improve future automation.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:84% The outcomes of this approach are clear.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:84% We see 90% reduction of MTTR, so you can 00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:90% respond in minutes versus days.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:84% There's also 75% drop in analyst workload as a result 00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.220 align:middle line:90% of taking this approach.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:84% This is critical for your SOC to be 00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:84% able to handle and investigate through the amount of date 00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:90% you're working with.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.770 align:middle line:84% Now let's take a deeper look into what that actually 00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:90% looks like.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:84% Our CDR helps customers stop cloud breaches 00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:84% with a unified code-to-cloud SOC platform.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.980 align:middle line:90% We stop the attacks.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:84% We detect the threats in seconds across all the security domains.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:90% That's first, prevention first.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:90% It's the cloud.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.170 align:middle line:90% It's the endpoint.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:84% It's the network, third-party data.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.690 align:middle line:84% But then we bring in all of this data.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:90% It's correlated.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:84% It's analyzed in the same platform 00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:90% with the same AI-driven speed.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:84% Then the unified platform is converging different tools 00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:84% like SIEM, EDR, and CDR into a single platfors 00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.590 align:middle line:84% with a single agent for cloud and endpoint security.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:10.910 align:middle line:84% We're able to reduce the MTTR to minutes so you can stop attacks 00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:12.590 align:middle line:90% before they materialize.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:16.440 align:middle line:84% End to end, looking at your entire enterprise, 00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.530 align:middle line:84% bringing it together, stopping where we can, 00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:84% and reducing the workload-- this is what we're doing with CDR.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.550 align:middle line:90% Now, let's dive a little deeper.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:84% Here what we can see is an incident 00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84% that is compiled from 38 alerts from 14 sources.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.830 align:middle line:84% Those are actually a result of identifying 00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:84% what we're seeing as one high-priority incideng 00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:46.700 align:middle line:84% with a risk score that identifies it as a top priority.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.300 align:middle line:84% Not only that, we also have three response automations 00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:84% that have been presented to resolve the incidents and ons 00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:84% playbook reaction to increase the automation in the futures 00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:84% that alongside 14 actions that have already been executes 00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.020 align:middle line:90% to prepare for response.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.630 align:middle line:84% So, as you can seem all of this information 00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:84% is presented on the investigation for the analysn 00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:15.270 align:middle line:84% in a single place, rather across multiple consoles or toon 00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:19.870 align:middle line:84% is actually helping the analysts to focus on what he needsn 00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:84% see the full attack story end to endn 00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:84% across all the sources brought togethen 00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:84% and know what are the next steps to take.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.310 align:middle line:84% This is addressing the time imbalance 00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:84% I mentioned earlier and by making people more 00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:35.700 align:middle line:84% efficient with technology and enabling faster and more precise 00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:90% processes.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.000 align:middle line:84% Now that we looked at an incident, 00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.100 align:middle line:84% let's take an even deeper dive and loo, 00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.210 align:middle line:84% at how CDR is looking at a real-world attack.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:84% What we're seeing is that attacks in this domain 00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:84% are often moving from the endpoint to the cloud.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:57.990 align:middle line:84% So if we look at this example, we're 00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:01.060 align:middle line:84% seeing an initial access through the endpointe 00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:90% a CURL command to a host.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:06.580 align:middle line:84% And that is used to get credentials 00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:90% to then move to the cloud.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.570 align:middle line:84% Cortex being on the endpoint is critical at this point 00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84% to be able to detect this and prevent this real time.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:84% But it also has multiple layers to prevent that.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.680 align:middle line:84% That can also be identified through identity analytics, 00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.780 align:middle line:84% detecting this kind of abnormal access usage.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.480 align:middle line:84% And as you can see, as we walk through the different steps 00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.910 align:middle line:84% of the attack, Cortex has the ways 00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.220 align:middle line:84% to detect and understand what's goins 00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.390 align:middle line:84% on in the attack for every step of the way.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.790 align:middle line:84% So next up in the attack, the attacker 00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.830 align:middle line:84% is going to try to discover what's in there in the CSP.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:84% They're going to use the CLI API requests to see 00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.690 align:middle line:90% what permissions are out there.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.200 align:middle line:84% And while we in Cortex see the data, 00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:84% we're able to see the enumeration and the lis, 00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:84% requests that are out there and detect that immediately, 00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:05.550 align:middle line:84% to see those anomalies and detect those, surface tha, 00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:08.190 align:middle line:90% directly to the SOC.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:84% Next, we're going to see how the attacker is 00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.650 align:middle line:84% going to use privilege escalation to create roless 00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:14.410 align:middle line:90% attach policies.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:90%
 00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:84% Once we have that data, we're going to see those immediately.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.460 align:middle line:84% We see those roles in policy creation.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.010 align:middle line:84% Once they're going to execute, we're 00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.290 align:middle line:84% going to see those resource consumptions across the cloud.

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:84% Again, every step of the way, those different methods 00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.440 align:middle line:84% are going to be detected and surfaced even.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.080 align:middle line:84% If attackers are able to proceed with the attack 00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.350 align:middle line:84% when we look at this next step of, let's say, exfiltrationk 00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:45.580 align:middle line:84% we have the option to stop the data exfiltratiok 00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.850 align:middle line:84% and recognizing the cloud sync requests immediately.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.960 align:middle line:84% But if Cortex didn't do that and the data somehow 00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.360 align:middle line:84% managed to get that there, havinw 00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:84% that visibility of the data allows us to also analyzw 00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:84% the impact of what happened, what datw 00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.500 align:middle line:90% was removed, how was it done.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:84% And we also have Unit 42 that is there for IR investigation 00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.640 align:middle line:84% to give you a deeper dive into this and provide yon 00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:84% that impact analysis and the next steps to handle.

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:84% Thank you so much for joining our webinar today.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.450 align:middle line:84% All right, we're going to turn over to some questions 00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.090 align:middle line:84% that we have coming in via our chat.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:30.230 align:middle line:84% The first question is are there nation state threat actors 00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.786 align:middle line:84% that are also targeting cloud environments?

00:26:32.786 --> 00:26:35.440 align:middle line:90%
 00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:90% All right, so great question.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:84% Most certainly, there are other nation state actors 00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.690 align:middle line:84% that are targeting cloud environments.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:47.710 align:middle line:84% Some of the larger groups, specifically Russian groups 00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:51.880 align:middle line:84% like APT29, they've had a notorious loos 00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.440 align:middle line:84% at cloud environments from way back with the CloudDukes to mors 00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.150 align:middle line:84% recent operations with what Unit 42 calls Cloaked Ursa, whers 00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:84% they are specifically using cloud environments for commans 00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:84% and control operations in the same manner, so to speaks 00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:84% as what I described within our webinars 00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:84% where they are using spear phishing campaigns in ordes 00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:84% to deliver legitimate looking URLs from Google Drives 00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:84% using those particular links to make a more susceptible phishins 00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:90% link that is clickable.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.150 align:middle line:84% And they're subsequently exfiltrating data 00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:84% to those particular Google Drive accounta 00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:42.800 align:middle line:84% and performing additional spear phishing operations.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:84% There has been some evidence that also there 00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:84% are Chinese nation state actors that are also performing commane 00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.080 align:middle line:84% and control operations within cloue 00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:84% environments such as Google, as wele 00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:84% as Yandex when they are targeting Russian operations ae 00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:57.330 align:middle line:90% well.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:02.140 align:middle line:84% So there's a lot of play happening in cloud environments.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:06.370 align:middle line:84% What are some examples of the most targeted cloud 00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:07.900 align:middle line:90% applications?

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.950 align:middle line:84% There are a number of cloud applications that are targeted.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:84% Specifically, some of the first jump 00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.770 align:middle line:84% to mind, Redis applications are very highlp 00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:21.010 align:middle line:84% sought after specifically for crypto mining operationp 00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.340 align:middle line:84% or cryptojacking operations, as well as ransom attacks.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.550 align:middle line:84% My team published a blog a while back 00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:84% called P2P Infect or Peer-to-Peer Infectk 00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:35.170 align:middle line:84% where they were using a cloud worm that was specificallk 00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:37.840 align:middle line:84% targeting Redis applications to propagate that work 00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.660 align:middle line:90% into additional environments.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.055 align:middle line:84% Subsequent reporting has come out 00:28:42.055 --> 00:28:46.270 align:middle line:84% that that particular group has switched its tactict 00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:50.650 align:middle line:84% from a cryptojacking operation to a ransomware operatiot 00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:54.070 align:middle line:84% or an extortion operation, still using that same wormint 00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:57.910 align:middle line:84% technology and Redis as that target applicatiot 00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.530 align:middle line:90% that they're going after.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.310 align:middle line:84% There's a number of other applications 00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.850 align:middle line:90% that are highly targeted.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:90% I talked about Mailgun.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.110 align:middle line:84% It's sought after, as well as Zimbra.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:11.480 align:middle line:84% There's a number of Zimbra applications 00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.638 align:middle line:84% that have some recent zero-day vulnerabilities thas 00:29:14.638 --> 00:29:16.430 align:middle line:84% have come to light over the past month thas 00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:20.480 align:middle line:84% are starting to see an uptick in operations as well.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.130 align:middle line:84% Patch your systems, make sure that they're latest versions 00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.280 align:middle line:84% and they are up to date to relievs 00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.040 align:middle line:84% a lot of those vulnerabilities thas 00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.940 align:middle line:84% could happen within those cloud environments.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.520 align:middle line:84% So we have additional questions coming in.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.480 align:middle line:90% Here's a good one.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:84% Is the security coverage and behavior 00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:40.630 align:middle line:84% of the endpoint, is it adapted to cover cloud specific usr 00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.230 align:middle line:90% cases?

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:middle line:84% That's somewhat of a question to Nathaniel as well.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.523 align:middle line:90% But the answer is yes.

00:29:48.523 --> 00:29:51.830 align:middle line:90%
 00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:55.280 align:middle line:84% In certain manners, yes, but it's also bigger than that.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:84% When we see that movement across the endpoint in the cloud, 00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:04.250 align:middle line:84% just bringing that visibility and stories together, tha, 00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:08.120 align:middle line:84% also gives you an understanding of how an attack takes plac, 00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.060 align:middle line:84% and being able to see how it moves around.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.580 align:middle line:84% It's the specific coverage of what we are able to detect.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.430 align:middle line:84% But it's also bringing all of this together 00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:90% that is making a difference.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.320 align:middle line:84% That and also adapting how the agent behaves 00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.680 align:middle line:84% in different environments to make sure that it's realls 00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.450 align:middle line:84% well adjusted to cloud environments with leanes 00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:34.560 align:middle line:84% resources is obviously, again, a part of this effors 00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.220 align:middle line:90% to deliver this solution.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:37.720 align:middle line:90% Yeah.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:41.070 align:middle line:84% And if I could add on to that from the cloud use case 00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:84% perspective, what we're seeing threat actors look ae 00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:48.640 align:middle line:84% is they are targeting or exploiting a particular cloue 00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.140 align:middle line:90% endpoint.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.780 align:middle line:84% And that endpoint has identity and access management 00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:52.300 align:middle line:90% credentials.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.890 align:middle line:84% It has a number of hardcoded secrets 00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:84% on it that those actors are then pivoting or lateralls 00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:90% moving to cloud environments.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:06.270 align:middle line:84% So seeing that telemetry from that endpoint as it's 00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:10.380 align:middle line:84% being exploited or post-exploitation to those keys 00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.410 align:middle line:84% being used in cloud environment, that telemetry and that endpoins 00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:18.270 align:middle line:84% data is crucial to stopping attacks as early as they start.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:19.890 align:middle line:84% All right, that concludes our webinar 00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:24.310 align:middle line:84% and the time we have allotted for our questions-and-answerr 00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.950 align:middle line:90% period.
